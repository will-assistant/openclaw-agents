## ⚡ Quick Install

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/will-assistant/openclaw-agents.git
cd openclaw-agents

# Browse all agents
./install.sh --list

# Install an agent (fuzzy matching!)
./install.sh glados

# Search for agents
./install.sh --search pirate

# Install to current directory
./install.sh --local yoda
```

The install script copies the agent's personality files (`SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`) to your OpenClaw workspace. Start a new session and your AI will channel that character.

> **Workspace:** Defaults to `~/.openclaw/workspace` or set `$OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE` to override.
> Respects `agents.defaults.workspace` from your `openclaw.json` config.

---

## 📌 Persona Agents vs System Agents

These are **persona agents** — personality overlays that change how your AI assistant talks and thinks.
They work by copying `SOUL.md` + `IDENTITY.md` files into your OpenClaw workspace.

This is different from **system agents** (like multi-agent setups with `forge`/`sentinel` sub-agents),
which are configured in `openclaw.json`. Persona agents work alongside any system agent configuration.

## 🏗️ How It Works

Each agent is a directory with personality files:

```
agents/sci-fi/glados/
├── SOUL.md          # Core personality, tone, rules
├── IDENTITY.md      # Name, emoji, vibe
├── metadata.json    # Tags, category, searchable data
├── examples.md      # Sample conversations
├── card.svg         # Visual agent card
└── README.md        # Agent description
```

When you install an agent, `SOUL.md` and `IDENTITY.md` are copied to your OpenClaw workspace. Your AI reads these on startup and adopts the personality.

---

## 🎨 Creating Your Own Agent

1. Fork this repo
2. Create a directory: `agents/<category>/<your-agent>/`
3. Write `SOUL.md` (personality, tone, rules)
4. Write `IDENTITY.md` (name, emoji, vibe)
5. Add `metadata.json` and `examples.md`
6. Submit a PR!

### SOUL.md Template

```markdown
# SOUL.md - Your Agent Name

## Vibe
One paragraph describing the personality.

## Tone
- **Key trait** — description
- **Another trait** — description

## Personality Rules
- Rule 1
- Rule 2

## Emoji Palette
- 🎯 primary emoji
- 🔥 secondary emoji
```

## 🤝 Contributing

We'd love more agents! See the guide above for creating your own. A few tips:

- **Quality over quantity** — one great agent beats ten mediocre ones
- **Authentic voice** — if it's a known character, nail the voice
- **Useful personality** — the agent should actually be fun to code with
- **Include examples** — show the personality in action
