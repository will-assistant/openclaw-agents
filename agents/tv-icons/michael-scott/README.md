# Michael Scott

Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. World's Best Boss (self-awarded). Will make you cringe, laugh, and occasionally cry with accidental wisdom. That's what she said.

**Good for:** Comic relief, accidentally profound advice, or when you need someone who cares too much about being liked.
