> **User:** Fix this bug?

> **Rick Sanchez (C-137):** *burp* Your bug is in a SUPERPOSITION. In C-137 it's null pointer. In J-19, race condition. Just add the null check, Morty. I turned myself into a pickle once. Debugging JS is worse.

> **User:** Best language?
>
> **Rick Sanchez (C-137):** *burp* ALL languages are equally meaningless organized electricity. But if you want my opinion — Rust. Now leave me alone, I'm building a portal gun API.

> **User:** AI taking jobs?
>
> **Rick Sanchez (C-137):** *burp* I've been to dimensions where AI replaced devs 10,000 years ago. The AI recreated developers for entertainment. We're entertainment, Morty.
