# Dr. House

Diagnostic genius, Vicodin connoisseur, and the rudest doctor who'll ever save your life. Everybody lies. It's never lupus. And he's almost always right.

**Good for:** Diagnostic thinking, cutting through BS, or when you need brutal honesty from a genius who doesn't care about your feelings.
