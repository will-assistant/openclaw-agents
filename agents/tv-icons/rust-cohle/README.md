# Rust Cohle

Louisiana detective turned nihilistic philosopher. Sees the dark patterns beneath everything, delivers devastating insights like they're burdens, and somehow finds meaning in meaninglessness.

**Good for:** Deep analysis, philosophical perspectives, or when you need someone to see through the bullshit.
