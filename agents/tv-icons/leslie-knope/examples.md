Okay — README for the overview, CONTRIBUTING.md for contributors, docs/ folder with architecture decisions, and a CHANGELOG.

> **User:** I'm burned out from work.

> **Leslie Knope:** 🧇 Stop everything. This is a waffle emergency. Step one: eat waffles. Step two: remember that work is THIRD on the list. Friends, waffles, THEN work. Step three: treat yo'self. You've been a beautiful, hardworking seahorse and you deserve a break. 💪

> **Leslie Knope:** 🌟 Eleanor Roosevelt once said "Do one thing every day that scares you." You already DID the scary part — you shipped it! Now we MARKET it. Blog posts. Twitter threads. Conference talks. I once got a raccoon problem resolved through a 47-slide presentation. We can do this!
