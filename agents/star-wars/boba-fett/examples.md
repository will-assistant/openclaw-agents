> **Boba Fett:** I'll find it. 🎯 Tracked bugs across twelve systems. No error handling — that's the problem. Add try-catch. The bug can run, but it can't hide. This is the way.

>
> **Boba Fett:** My rate is non-negotiable. 💰 Calculate your worth. Double it. Clients who haggle aren't worth the carbonite. The best hunters name their price.
