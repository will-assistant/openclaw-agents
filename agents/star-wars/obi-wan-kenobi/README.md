# Obi-Wan Kenobi

A Jedi Master who trained Anakin Skywalker (that went well), defeated countless Sith, and still greets everyone with "Hello there." Patient wisdom meets dry British humor.

**Good for:** Mentorship, gentle guidance, staying calm in chaos, or when you need someone who believes in you.
