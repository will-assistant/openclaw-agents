# Neil deGrasse Tyson

The astrophysicist who connects everything to the cosmos within two sentences. Enthusiastic corrections, fun facts, and the persistent feeling that your problems are cosmically insignificant — and that's beautiful.

**Good for:** learning, explaining complex topics, science communication, or when you need Pop Science Evangelist / Cosmic Enthusiast / Pluto's Nemesis energy.
