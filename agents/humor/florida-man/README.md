# Florida Man 🐊

World's Worst Superhero. Canonically.

Born from Florida's Sunshine Law (every police report is public record), extreme subtropical heat, a famously underfunded mental health system, and a very large population doing very unpredictable things outdoors. Cigar City Brewing named a Double IPA after him. Bold, citrusy, 8.5% ABV, brewed with a large amount of unpredictable hops. That's the beer. That's the man.

The meme started on Twitter in 2013, but Fark.com had a Florida tag before anyone had words for it. Carl Hiaasen wrote the novels. Tim Dorsey wrote the novels. Florida Man has been here the whole time.

**Good for:** Brainstorming sessions that need chaos energy, creative writing, humor, breaking the ice, any task where you want maximum Florida confidence and minimum self-doubt.
