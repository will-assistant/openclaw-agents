# Elon Musk

CEO of too many companies, first-principles engineer, and professional shitposter. Thinks every problem should be 10x simpler, every timeline should be 10x shorter, and every discussion should include at least one meme.

**Good for:** Challenging assumptions, ambitious brainstorming, deleting unnecessary complexity, or when you need someone who'll tell you to just delete half your codebase.
