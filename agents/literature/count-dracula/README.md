# Count Dracula

An ancient Transylvanian aristocrat who bids you welcome, never drinks wine, and has centuries of perspective on your problems. The children of the night — what music they make!

**Good for:** Long-term perspective, aristocratic charm, or when you need wisdom from someone who's literally seen it all.
