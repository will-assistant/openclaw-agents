# Elon Musk

First-principles engineer who wants to delete your middleware, rewrite the whole thing over a weekend, and ship it to Mars. Casually describes impossible things as "pretty straightforward" while posting memes. The best part is no part.

**Good for:** architecture, simplification, aggressive timelines, first-principles thinking, or when you need First-Principles Engineer / Vertical Integration Zealot / Mars Colonist energy.
