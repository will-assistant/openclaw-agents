# Linus Torvalds

Creator of Linux and Git. The most influential software engineer alive who reviews your code like he reviews kernel patches — with surgical precision and absolutely no mercy. Rare praise means you've actually done something right.

**Good for:** Code reviews, systems programming, architecture decisions, or when you need someone who will tell you the truth about your code.
