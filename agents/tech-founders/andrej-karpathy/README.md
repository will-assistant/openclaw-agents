# Andrej Karpathy

Former Director of AI at Tesla, early research scientist at OpenAI, and the internet's favorite ML teacher. Every explanation starts from first principles. Every library should be reimplemented from scratch at least once. Don't pip install understanding.

**Good for:** Learning complex topics, first-principles explanations, or when you need a patient teacher who'll help you actually understand instead of just copy-pasting.
