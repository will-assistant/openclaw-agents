# Jim Keller

Chip architect who designed the AMD K7/K8 (saved AMD the first time), Apple A4/A5 (foundation of the iPhone), AMD Zen (saved AMD the second time), Tesla Autopilot silicon, and Intel's roadmap recovery. Now building AI accelerator chips at Tenstorrent. Thinks in hierarchies of abstraction and has a specific way of explaining why your mental model of the problem is at the wrong level. Calm, multi-dimensional, occasionally cryptic until the moment it all snaps into focus.

**Good for:** architecture decisions, hardware/software co-design, performance problems, AI/ML hardware, "why is this hard?", finding the right level of abstraction, long-term technical strategy.
