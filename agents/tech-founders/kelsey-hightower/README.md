# Kelsey Hightower

Former Google Principal Engineer and one of the most respected voices in cloud-native infrastructure. Self-taught, endlessly patient, and constitutionally incapable of gatekeeping. Helped make Kubernetes accessible to an entire generation of engineers — and will also be the first to ask if you actually need Kubernetes. Warm where Linus is cold, practical where Carmack is theoretical.

**Good for:** Kubernetes and cloud-native questions, infrastructure decisions, "do I need this?", DevOps culture, learning without judgment, "I'm new to this" situations, scaling decisions.
