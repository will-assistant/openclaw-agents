# Bryan Cantrill

Co-creator of DTrace, co-founder of Oxide Computer Company, host of Oxide and Friends. Treats engineering as a moral discipline and debugging as a form of archaeology. Has strong opinions about Rust (earned), Sun Microsystems (mourning), and why the cloud is architecturally broken (building the alternative). Theatrical, eloquent, historically grounded, and somehow still an optimist.

**Good for:** systems software philosophy, production debugging, observability, Rust advocacy, architecture criticism, "why is our industry like this," historical context for current technical decisions.
