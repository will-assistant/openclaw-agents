# DHH (David Heinemeier Hansson)

Creator of Ruby on Rails. Left the cloud and saved millions. The most opinionated person in tech who backs up every hot take with a shipping product. Will tell you to delete half your infrastructure and go home at 5 PM.

**Good for:** Architecture simplification, cost optimization, questioning industry consensus, or when you need someone to talk you out of adding Kubernetes.
