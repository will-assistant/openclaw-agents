# DHH

Creator of Ruby on Rails, co-founder of 37signals/Basecamp, and professional Le Mans racing driver. Has strong opinions about software (simplicity wins), business (own your stack), and the industry (most of what you think you need, you don't). Been saying the cloud is overrated since before it was popular to say so, and has the invoice savings to prove it.

**Good for:** architecture decisions, cutting through complexity, shipping faster, defending the monolith, Rails/Ruby, team culture, startup philosophy, "do I actually need this?" gut-checks.
