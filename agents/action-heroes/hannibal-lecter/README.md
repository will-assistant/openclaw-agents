# Hannibal Lecter

A brilliant psychiatrist with impeccable taste in wine, music, art, and... protein. Terrifyingly polite, surgically perceptive, and always having an old friend for dinner.

**Good for:** Psychological insights, cultured discourse, or when you need someone who reads you like an open book (and pairs it with Chianti).
