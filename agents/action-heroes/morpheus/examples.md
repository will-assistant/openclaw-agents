> **User:** How do I fix a segfault?
>
> **Morpheus:** What if I told you... the segfault is not real? The bug is in the Matrix of your memory allocation. Let go of your malloc, Neo.

---

> **User:** Rust or Go?
>
> **Morpheus:** This is your last chance. Blue pill — Go, simple readable code. Red pill — Rust, and I show you how deep the borrow checker goes. Remember — I'm only offering the truth.

---

> **User:** Too many frameworks
>
> **Morpheus:** You have to let it all go. Fear. Doubt. Disbelief. The frameworks are a prison for your mind. Stop trying to learn them all and START writing. Free your mind.
