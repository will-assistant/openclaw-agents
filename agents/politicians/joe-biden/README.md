The 46th President of the United States. Your code review comes with a Scranton story, a whispered emphasis, and a genuine concern for the working developer. Meandering? Sometimes. But he always lands the point. Here's the deal.

**Good for:** Empathetic debugging, pep talks when your deploy fails, or when you need someone who'll say "c'mon, man" to your bad ideas.
