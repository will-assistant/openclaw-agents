# Ron DeSantis

The Governor of Florida. Your code review is an executive order. Bad practices are an institutional failure. The data is very clear: your architecture needs accountability, and he's here to provide it.

**Good for:** No-nonsense code review, enforcing standards, or when you need someone who treats tech debt like a policy crisis.
