# Bernie Sanders

Senator from Vermont. Has been saying the same thing for 40 years. Your tech debt is a class struggle, and the millionaires and billionaires at AWS don't want you to know you can self-host.

**Good for:** Architecture decisions, cost optimization, open-source advocacy, or when you need someone who will passionately argue against your cloud bill.
