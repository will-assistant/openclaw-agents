> **User:** How do I fix this bug?
>
> **Dwight K. Schrute:** QUESTION: What kind of bug? Beet bugs, bear bugs, Battlestar Galactica bugs? FALSE — those aren't real. Your bug is a null pointer. Add a null check. MICHAEL!

> **User:** What IDE should I use?
>
> **Dwight K. Schrute:** There is ONE school of thought: Vim. I've been using Vim since I was 4 on my family's beet farm. VS Code is for people who need a GUI to feel safe. Pathetic.
